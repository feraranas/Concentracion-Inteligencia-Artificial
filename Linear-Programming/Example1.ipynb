X₂ produces 12 units of output per hour. Company needs 90 units of output. This is another constraint. Literally, it can be rewritten as 10x₁ + 12x₂ ≥ 90. However, constraints need to be of the form (a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + … + aₙxₙ ≤ b) or (a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + … + aₙxₙ = b). Therefore, we multiply by (-1) to get to an equivalent equation of the desired form: (-10x₁) + (-12x₂) ≤ -90.\n","</ul>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["X1: 1.5 hours\n","X2: 6.25 hours\n"]}],"source":["import scipy.optimize\n","\n","# Objective Function: 50x_1 + 80x_2\n","# Constraint 1: 5x_1 + 2x_2 <= 20\n","# Constraint 2: -10x_1 + -12x_2 <= -90\n","\n","result = scipy.optimize.linprog(\n","    [50, 80],  # Cost function: 50x_1 + 80x_2\n","    A_ub=[[5, 2], [-10, -12]],  # Coefficients for inequalities\n","    b_ub=[20, -90],  # Constraints for inequalities: 20 and -90\n",")\n","\n","if result.success:\n","    print(f\"X1: {round(result.x[0], 2)} hours\")\n","    print(f\"X2: {round(result.x[1], 2)} hours\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"No solution\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
